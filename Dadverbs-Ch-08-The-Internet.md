1. If you wouldn't say it or do it to someone in person, don't post it on social media.
2. The majority of people use the Internet not for spreading goodwill but to complain.  Keep that in mind when you're reading product reviews.
3. If something online is free, the use of your information, your connections, your location, and related activity data is the payment.
4. Algorithms are always biased because they have objectives. What algorithm doesn't have an intended purpose?
5. If what you're saying is important and you have the option, favor richer forms of communication where people can hear your tone and see your body language.
