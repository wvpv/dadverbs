1. Honestly asking yourself "What's the worst thing that could happen?" is an effective way to keep a crisis in perspective.
2. If everything is a high-priority, then nothing is.  If everyone cuts to the front of the line, there's still a line and now the other people in line are angry.
3. Things will not always go as planned or turn out how you envisioned.  It's OK.  As the poet Mike Tyson once said, "Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth."
4. If you can't remember what clothes you wore a week ago, others won't remember either.  We're often confident we know what others think about us, but most of the time we get ourselves worked up for nothing.
5. It's good to consider who is behind the camera. We often think we are seeing what we are seeing, but in reality, we see what the camera operators, producers, and directors want us to see.
6. There's a chance that the Yahootie actually did do it.  Mom said so.
