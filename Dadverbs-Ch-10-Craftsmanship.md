1. Don't assume that something simple is easy or quick to build.  As DaVinci said, "simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."
2. Take time to explicitly appreciate fine craftsmanship and skilled handiwork.  A lot of effort probably went into it.
3. Try to do it yourself, or at least research what's involved.  If you end up paying someone else to do it, you'll have some respect for the work involved.  You'll also know if you're paying a fair price.
