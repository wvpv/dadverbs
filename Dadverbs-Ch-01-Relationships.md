#. No one cares about your welfare more than your parents.  They've been carrying the responsibility burden for you longer than anyone else.
#. If the people around you always tell you "yes" and never "no" then they don't truly care about you.
#. Refrain from gifting what the recipient collects as a hobby -- unless you collect it, too.
#. Get good at asking open-ended questions and leaning in to listen.  It's a good way to get to know someone.
#. Be content letting other people notice your skills and effort.  Your actions can speak for themselves.  When you know you did something amazing, smile, high-five yourself, and leave it at that.
#. Communication is not just words on a page or screen.  It includes your actions, tone of voice, and facial expressions, too.
#. If you don't verbalize your expectations, you are setting yourself up for disappointment.
#. Boasting about your virtuous deeds puts your priorities and motives in question. Those announcements negate most of the goodness in the results.
#. Mark Twain once said, "Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference."
