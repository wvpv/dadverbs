1. Resist the impulse to buy something to just make yourself feel better.  It rarely works.  Let purchasing decisions simmer.   Don't give in to any pressure to make a decision right now.
2. Be wary of those constantly trying to sell you something or those that don't value you as an individual capable of managing your own life.  Know that your attention, your sense of belonging, or fear of missing out are direct lines to your bank account.
3. You're a slave to your debtors.  Pay off your debts as soon as you can.
