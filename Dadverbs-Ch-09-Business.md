1. The Harley Davidson brand is essentially the same as the Apple brand, but with more leather.
2. Be wary of any business that takes advantage of people who aren't good at math.  As it's been said, "a fool and his money are soon parted".
3. Adding more people so a project gets done faster usually has the opposite effect.  The cost of the context and knowledge transfer is almost always excluded from that planning process.
4. Plan to walk across the finish line.
5. Capriciously changing the rules after work has started is a sure-fire way to make everyone on the implementation team mad.
6. Just like in personal relationships, gracefully saying "no" to a prospect or client is a good way of building trust and long-term value in the relationship.
7. Some people wear "busy", "stressed" or "overworked" like a badge.  Most of the time it means their attention is so divided that they're not doing anything well.  Set explicit boundaries so you are not bound to their mediocrity.
8. If you don't have a firm grasp on the technical details of the project, don't speak and manage others as if you do.  Technical misstatements are typically difficult or costly to walk back later.  Theodore Roosevelt once said: "The best executive is the one who has sense enough to pick good men to do what he wants done, and self-restraint to keep from meddling with them while they do it."
9. If you're going to document requirements, be sure and include "the why" not just "the how."  "The how" is often obvious as time goes on, but the decision-making process and the rationale are what those that follow will seek to understand.
10. Don't try to scale to meet increased demand without reinvesting some of the gains in the infrastructure to support it.  It's not always obvious what constitutes "infrastructure," but it's critical to sustain the growth.
11. Double-down on clients who are willing to cooperate as a partner and de-prioritize those that treat your work as a commodity.
12. "Under-promise and over-deliver" is only possible if you know what you're doing.
13. You can't set expectations effectively if you are not taking deliberate steps to build trust with the client stakeholders.  They should have plenty of reasons to believe you when you say "this is the best way to do it."
14. Listen for opportunities to demonstrate your team's expertise.
