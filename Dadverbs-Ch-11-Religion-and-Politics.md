1. Your beliefs aren't truly yours until they are cemented by hardship and pain.
2. We are supposed to be judgmental, just not condemning.  Wisdom and discernment are underrated.
3. Grace is more powerful and effective than revenge or silence.  Both parties becoming aware of their role in the pain is the gateway to restoration.
4. Gently question those that speak in absolutes. Seek to understand why they believe so adamantly.  Strive to determine if the strong statements are born from reflection and examination or not.
5. Just because a visible and vocal group agrees on an issue, doesn't mean it's correct.  The majority can be wrong.  The loudest voice may not even represent the majority.
6. Quietly call out hypocrisy.  Start with yourself first.
7. True science is pragmatic -- always testing and asking questions in order to form a hypothesis.  Hypotheses are not always facts.
