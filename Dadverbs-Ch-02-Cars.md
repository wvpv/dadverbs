1. Do the total cost of ownership math on your vehicle.  The best cars are usually the ones that get good gas mileage.
2. Invest in some floor mats that catch dirt.
3. Three essential car skills: Changing oil, replacing a flat tire with the spare, and using the parking brake to do a donut in the snow.
4. Paying attention is the most important rule of driving.
5. The fast lane is never faster during rush hour.  Generally speaking, people who treat it that way are the ones that make it worse.
