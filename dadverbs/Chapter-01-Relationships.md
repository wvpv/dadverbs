1. No one cares about your welfare more than your parents.  They've been carrying the responsibility burden for you longer than anyone else.
2. If the people around you always tell you "yes" and never "no" then they don't truly care about you.
3. Refrain from gifting what the recipient collects as a hobby -- unless you collect it, too.
4. Get good at asking open-ended questions and leaning in to listen.  It's a good way to get to know someone.
5. Be content letting other people notice your skills and effort.  Your actions can speak for themselves.  When you know you did something amazing, smile, high-five yourself, and leave it at that.
6. Communication is not just words on a page or screen.  It includes your actions, tone of voice, and facial expressions, too.
7. If you don't verbalize your expectations, you are setting yourself up for disappointment.
8. Boasting about your virtuous deeds puts your priorities and motives in question. Those announcements negate most of the goodness in the results.
9. Mark Twain once said, "Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference."
