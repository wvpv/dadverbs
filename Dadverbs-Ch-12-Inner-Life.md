1. If you tell a lie, you'll always be in bigger trouble than if you just told the truth and faced the consequences.
2. Watch out for those "it's not that big of a deal" parts of your life.  You should do something decisive about them.
3. It's perfectly fine to be angry when you know you own an item but can't remember where you put it. Put it in a more logical place next time.
4. Get up early and enjoy the time to yourself.
