1. You learn the most when you screw it up the worst.
2. If you give away all the answers freely, you're depriving someone of the satisfaction and ownership of figuring it out.
3. Occasionally take time to think about how much you've learned and from whom.
4. Learn enough about a topic to form an opinion.  The same goes for trying new things.
5. Be sure statements like "that's too much trouble" don't turn you into a lazy person.  Often challenging tasks are the most satisfying to master.
6. Sometimes starting over is a lot of work, but the second go-around is much faster.  That's because you're smarter now than when you first started.
7. As dad used to say, "hide and watch."
8. If you're not sure what you should be doing, sweep, pick up and organize.
9. Sometimes it's difficult to be sincere when you're disparaged by someone ignorant.  Chalk it up to them not knowing any better.  You've been in that position before.
10. As the old Russian saying goes, "doveryai, no proveryai" -- trust, but verify.
11. At some point, everyone has learned to wipe their own butt.
